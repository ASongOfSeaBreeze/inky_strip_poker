# inky_strip_poker
Source code for an inky editor produced strip poker game published on literotica

If you want the full source code, look at source_code.txt

If you want to make your own version and just want the gameplay structure, see unfilled_source_code.txt. That version is still fairly custom to my exact game and would require some work to customize yourself, but you wouldn't have to figure out how to delete all the story specific conditional content.
